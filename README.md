### Hi there 👋

- 🧪 I currently lecture and research in [food science](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aw1EnaIAAAAJ&hl=en) at an Irish
university
- 🖥️ I’m a [self-taught programmer](https://github.com/edibotopic?tab=repositories) and like to experiment with multiple languages
- 📃 I'm fascinated by documentation and have contributed
to docs for some of my favourite open-source projects, including [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) 
- 🎹 I create(d) experimental music as [Curtsy Rehearsed](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/)
- ✏️  I maintain [a blog](https://edibotopic.com) where I write on topics of a technical and philosophical nature
- 📜 I published a free [peer-reviewed article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c01201) in an education journal about
my [web-based physics simulation](https://github.com/edibotopic/stokes-law)
- 🤫 I'm currently developing a Python package for working with the Dispersed
System Formalism (DSF), based on my [dsf-racket](https://edibotopic.com/blog/dsf-racket/) module

If you want to collaborate on food, code, writing or music please send an email to [edibotopic@gmail.com](mailto:edibotopic@gmail.com).
