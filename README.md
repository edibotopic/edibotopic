### Hi there 👋

- ✍️ I'm a Technical Author at Canonical.
- 🧪 Before that I was a teacher and researcher in food science. [Here are my publications in that area](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aw1EnaIAAAAJ&hl=en).
- 🖥️ I dabble in [code](https://github.com/edibotopic?tab=repositories) and like to make small, useful things whenever I can.
