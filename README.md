### Hi there 👋

- 🧪 I currently teach and research in [food science](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aw1EnaIAAAAJ&hl=en) at an Irish
university
- 🖥️ I’m a [self-taught programmer](https://github.com/edibotopic?tab=repositories) and like to make small, useful things in different languages
- ✏️  I maintain [a blog](https://edibotopic.com) where I write on topics of a technical and philosophical nature
- 📜 I published a free [peer-reviewed article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c01201) in an education journal about
my [web-based physics simulation](https://github.com/edibotopic/stokes-law)
- 🎹 I create(d) experimental music as [Curtsy Rehearsed](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/)
