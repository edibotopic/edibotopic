### Hi there 👋

- ✍️ I'm a Technical Author at Canonical.
- 🧪 Before that I was a teacher and researcher in food science. [Here are my publications in that area](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aw1EnaIAAAAJ&hl=en).
- 🖥️ I dabble in [code](https://github.com/edibotopic?tab=repositories) and like to make small, useful things whenever I can.

I don't use social media, even that-new-one-which-solves-the-problems-of-the-old-one. You can contact me at [edibotopic@gmail.com](mailto: edibotopic@gmail.com).
