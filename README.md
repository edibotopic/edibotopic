### Hi there 👋

- 🧪 I currently lecture and research in [food science](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aw1EnaIAAAAJ&hl=en) at an Irish
university
- 🖥️ I’m a [self-taught programmer](https://github.com/edibotopic?tab=repositories) and like to experiment with multiple languages
- 📃 I'm fascinated by documentation and have contributed
to docs for some of my favourite open-source projects, including [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) 
- 🎹 I create experimental music as [Curtsy Rehearsed](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/)
- ✏️ I maintain [a blog](https://edibotopic.com) where I write on topics of a technical and philosophical nature
- 🤫 Soon I will finalise the publication of a peer-reviewed
article on a [web-based physics simulation](https://github.com/edibotopic/stokes-law) I made and publish course notes rewritten according to the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework

If you want to collaborate on food, code, writing or music please send an email to [edibotopic@gmail.com](mailto:edibotopic@gmail.com).
