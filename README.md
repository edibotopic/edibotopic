### Hi there 👋

- 🧪 I currently lecture and research in food science at an Irish
university
- 🖥️ I’m a self-taught programmer who tries to use whatever language
is appropriate to the project at hand
- 📃 I've been contributing to other open-source projects, especially
in the area of documentation 
- 🎹 I create experimental music as [Curtsy Rehearsed](https://bandcamp.com/curtsyrehearsed)
- ✏️  I maintain [a blog](https://edibotopic.com) where I write on topics of a technical and philosophical nature

If you want to collaborate on food, code, writing or music please send an email to [edibotopic@gmail.com](mailto:edibotopic@gmail.com).
