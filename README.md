### Hi there 👋

- ✍️ I'm a Technical Author at Canonical
- 🧪 Before that I was a teacher and researcher in food science. [Here's a few dozen publications on that stuff](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aw1EnaIAAAAJ&hl=en).
- 🖥️ I dabble in [coding](https://github.com/edibotopic?tab=repositories) and like to make small, useful things whenever I can.
- ✏️  I maintain [a blog](https://edibotopic.com), where I write loosely on topics of a technical and philosophical nature.
- 🎹 I created experimental music as [Curtsy Rehearsed](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) from 2021-2024.
- 🤫 I'm always working on other secret stuff...
